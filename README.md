## 📊 Google Play Store EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset of over 10,000 Android applications available on the Google Play Store. The aim is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

---

## 🎯 Objective

🔹 Explore the structure and quality of the dataset

🔹 Clean and preprocess data (handling nulls, formatting issues)

🔹 Analyze patterns in app ratings, installs, reviews, and categories

🔹 Identify key insights to understand top-performing apps

## 🧪 What is EDA?

EDA involves:

✅ Summarizing dataset characteristics

✅ Handling missing/inconsistent data

✅ Visualizing relationships between variables

✅ Detecting outliers or anomalies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python 3.x
  
📦 pandas – data manipulation and analysis  

🔢 numpy – numerical computation  

🧠 scikit-learn – used SimpleImputer for missing value handling  

📓 Jupyter Notebook – interactive coding and documentation
